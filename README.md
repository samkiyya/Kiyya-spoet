This project was a motivation from someone so special to me **Kiyya**

> Kiyya'spoet: Is a true definition that gives overview expressions from the heart and soul,
> which defines us as humans. In the creation of Man, Love, Emotions, Struggles, and Affections
> was something that makes us different from any other living things in the universe.
> This App was designed to help mankind to learn and to appreciate what love is.
> Here at Kiyya'spoet you are about to experience the true nature of human expressions
> and motivational quotes that will uplift the mind and growth. Man can't do it alone
> and so we all need words that can change our mindsets, words that can encourage us
> to strives. Motivational quotes are words that filled our souls with other sights to
> view all our difficulty in life and interwhine it to focus on life.
> This is the reason why Kiyya'spoet came to an existance, to support and ellivate mankind
> to be hopeful in Love and growth. Stay with us as we give out new updates for both poets
